## Development

In order to setup development environment and add/modify exciting features use one of the options listed below (or let us know if you have an alternative ðŸŽ‰):

-   use proxy to direct API calls to a remote server. Convenient when back-end
    is deployed and has data. Just provide api hostname in `vite.config.js`
    and run with:

    ```
    yarn start
    ```
